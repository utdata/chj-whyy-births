WHYY project data cleanup. Problem was inconsistent data in multiple sheets that needed to be combined into single data frame.

```{r setup, echo=T, results='hide', message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(purrr)
```

## Import

This comes from [read-xl workflows](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/readxl-workflows.html#concatenate-worksheets-into-one-data-frame-1).

```{r}
path <- "data-raw/births-by-hospital-cleaned.xlsx"
sheets <- excel_sheets(path)
births <-
  lapply(excel_sheets(path), read_excel, path = path)
births <- lapply(seq_along(sheets), function(i) {
  data.frame(sheet = I(sheets[i]), births[[i]])
})
births <- do.call(rbind, births)

births %>% glimpse()
```
